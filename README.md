Custom list character is a simple plugin allowing you to choose which character to use when making bullet lists in Obsidian.

It adds the following features:

* new settings to choose the wanted charater between `-` (default), `*` and `+`
* new hotkey to bind to use the selected character to make or format your bullet lists
